Human communication relies on our ability to share thoughts and ideas. However, for millions of people who are deaf or hard of hearing, this process becomes challenging when others do not understand sign language. This project bridges that communication gap by converting sign language gestures (ASL/ISL) into audible speech—and vice versa—empowering inclusive interaction in everyday life.
Bridges the communication gap between the deaf and hearing communities by translating sign language (ASL/ISL) to voice and vice versa.
Real-time gesture recognition and speech synthesis using cameras/sensors and text-to-speech technologies for smooth interaction.
Designed with inclusivity in mind, with future expansion plans for global sign languages, contextual understanding, and mobile accessibility.
